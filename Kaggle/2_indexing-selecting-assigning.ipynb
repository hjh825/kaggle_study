If we have a DataFrame with index values `Apples, ..., Potatoes, ...`, and we want to select \"all the alphabetical fruit choices between Apples and Potatoes\", then it's a lot more convenient to index `df.loc['Apples':'Potatoes']` than it is to index something like `df.loc['Apples', 'Potatoet']` (`t` coming after `s` in the alphabet).\n\nThis is particularly confusing when the DataFrame index is a simple numerical list, e.g. `0,...,1000`. In this case `df.iloc[0:1000]` will return 1000 entries, while `df.loc[0:1000]` return 1001 of them!
